Assignment 1: Basic R practice
In this assignment, you will practice basic R programming concepts such as data types, control structures, functions, and data manipulation using various R packages.

Assignment 2:
In this assignment, you will work with the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset to predict if the sample was for malignant (cancerous) tissue. You will also input the zoo1.csv to train the decision tree classifier and come up with a decision tree to classify a new record into one of the categories. You will draw the decision tree and analyze its performance by calculating the classification accuracy on the training and testing datasets. Finally, you will experiment with the decision tree pruning parameters to see how they affect the performance of the tree.

Assignment 3: Predicting Earnings Manipulation by Indian firms using Machine Learning Algorithms
In this assignment, you will use various machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of earnings manipulation by Indian firms. You will explore the dataset and preprocess it for analysis. You will then apply different machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines to develop models for predicting earnings manipulation. You will compare the performance of these models and select the best one based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Assignment 4: Predicting Automobile Pricing Using Neural Networks
In this assignment, you will predict automobile pricing using neural networks. You will preprocess the dataset and select relevant features for analysis. You will then build and train a neural network model to predict automobile pricing. You will evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared. Finally, you will tune the hyperparameters of the neural network to improve its performance.
