## Project 1: Basic R practice
In this project, I practiced basic R programming concepts such as data types, control structures, functions, and data manipulation using various R packages.

## Project 2
In this project, I worked with the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset to predict if the sample was for malignant (cancerous) tissue. I also input the zoo1.csv to train the decision tree classifier and come up with a decision tree to classify a new record into one of the categories. I also drew the decision tree and analyzed its performance by calculating the classification accuracy on the training and testing datasets. Finally, I experimented with the decision tree pruning parameters to see how they affect the performance of the tree.

## Project 3: Predicting Earnings Manipulation by Indian firms using Machine Learning Algorithms
In this project, I used various machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of earnings manipulation by Indian firms. I explored the dataset and preprocess it for analysis. I then applied different machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees and random forest to develop models for predicting earnings manipulation. I then compared the performance of these models and select the best one based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Project 4: Predicting Automobile Pricing Using Neural Networks
In this project, I worked on predicting automobile pricing using neural networks. I then preprocessed the dataset and selected relevant features for analysis. I then built and trained a neural network model to predict automobile pricing. I also evaluated the performance of the model using metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared. Finally, I tuned the hyperparameters of the neural network to improve its performance.
